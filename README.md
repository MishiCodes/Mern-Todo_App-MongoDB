# Mern-Todo_App-MongoDB

Todo App built with the MERN stack along with Redux for state management, Reactstrap and react-transition-group. The MERN stack consists of MongoDB, Express, React / Redux, and Node. js. Given the popularity of React on the frontend and of Node. js on the backend, the MERN stack is one of the most popular stack of technologies for building a modern single-page app.
